We source our fruit from local farms to provide the freshest and most environmentally conscious ingredients we can. Sourcing ingredients from local farmers provide a shorter farm-to-table journey. Environmentalism is our number one priority at Banana Babe and that is why all the smoothies we sell 10% of the profits go towards the Amazon Rain Forest helping with deforestation. </p>
